function [x, r] = varimax( x, normalize, tol, it_max )
% VARIMAX - Rotate EOF's according to varimax algorithm
%
% This is actually a generic varimax routine and knows nothing special about
% EOFs.  It expects a matrix of "loadings".  Typically (in state space
% rotation), these loadings are the expansion coefficients (aka Principal
% Component Time Series) for the truncated basis of eigenvectors (EOFs), but
% they could also be the EOFs*diag(L)^(1/2) (in the case of rotation in
% sample space).
%
% Usage: [new_loads, rotmax] = varimax( loadings, normalize, tolerance, it_max )
%
% where all but the loadings are optional.  rotmax is the rotation matrix used.
%
% normalize determines whether or not to normalize the rows or columns of
% the loadings before performing the rotation.  If normalize is true, then
% the rows are normalized by there individual lengths.  Otherwise, no
% normalization is performed (default).  After rotation, the matrix is
% renormalized. Normalizing over the rows corresponds to the Kaiser
% normalization often used in factor analysis.
%
% tolerance defaults to 1e-10 if not given.  it_max specifies the maximum
% number of iterations to do - defaults to 1000.
%
% After the varimax rotation is performed, the new EOFs (in the case that
% the EC's were rotated - state space) can be found by new_eofs =
% eofs*rotmax.
%
% This function is derived from the R function varimax in the mva
% library.
